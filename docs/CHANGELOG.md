# Changelog

All notable changes to AutoApply are documented here, organized by Phase.

## [Unreleased] — Phase 2: Job Intake + Smart Filtering

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-02 — Phase 1: Infrastructure + Memory + Documents

### Phase 1.1: Project Initialization
- uv project with pyproject.toml (sqlalchemy, psycopg, pgvector, alembic, python-docx, pymupdf, etc.)
- PostgreSQL 14 + pgvector 0.7.4 installed and configured
- Alembic migrations with 5 tables: jobs, applications, applicant_profile, bullet_pool, qa_bank
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM models with vector columns and FK constraints
- Config loader (YAML + .env + env var overrides, credential URL encoding)
- LLM CLI wrapper (claude -p and codex exec via subprocess, with error handling)
- Logging setup (file + console with configurable level)

### Phase 1.2: Applicant Memory Layer
- Profile YAML schema definition (`data/profile/schema.yaml`)
- Profile loader: YAML → DB ingestion with tag extraction per section
- Bullet pool: extract tagged bullets from experiences/projects, query by tag overlap
- Story bank: STAR-format stories with theme/context filtering
- QA bank: structured Q&A with canonical answers, geography/role variants, confidence, review flag
- Resume importer: .docx/.pdf → Claude CLI → structured YAML

### Phase 1.3: Document Processing Layer
- Block-based docx engine: `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` substitution + section block rebuilding
- Section rebuilders clear stale template content before inserting new data
- PDF converter: docx2pdf with LibreOffice CLI fallback
- File manager: standardized naming (`type_company_role_date.ext`) + output path management
- Template registry with auto-discovery from template directory

### Post-Review Fixes (Codex review)
- **P1**: Migration now enables pgvector extension before creating VECTOR columns
- **P1**: Fixed table creation order (jobs before applications) for FK constraint
- **P2**: Added FK constraint `applications.job_id → jobs.id` in migration and ORM
- **P2**: Percent-encode DB credentials in connection URL (handles special characters)
- **P2**: Declared `pymupdf` as explicit dependency in pyproject.toml
- **P2**: `find_answer()` now ranks by pattern overlap score, not first-of-type
